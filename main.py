# construct used to check whether the Python script is being run directly by the Python interpreter, rather than being imported as a module into another script. This means that the chat_bot() function will only be executed if the Python script is run directly, not if it is imported into another script. It's a way to define the entry point of your script, ensuring that the chatbot logic is executed when the script is run as a standalone program.
